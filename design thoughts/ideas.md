# random ideas as they come to me

* a barrier that prevents your mental powers from going through - you need to fling objects through but you can't carry them through
* if an object is moving, and you grab it, velocity from that object is fed into om nom as it brings it to a stop

--- moved to do 
* wasm build with touch support 
* forces on om nom should be capped to prevent going nuclear 
* forces on om nom should be multiplied by the object's density such that a heavy object on the floor can be pushed down on to send om nom up even if it is all the way on the floor (this works well with force capping so that om nom doesn't fly to space)
